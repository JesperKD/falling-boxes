# falling-boxes
React assignment for possible job opportunity

Description:
- When the page loads the game starts.
- The letters are generated randomly. (A to E)
- Generated letters have random size and background color.
- If the user presses a key (on the keyboard) that represents a letter, it gets removed from the board if there are at least 2 of them. (E.g. pressing C removes all C letters)
- Each removed letter adds 1 point. (E.g. pressing A, removing 4 letters A, adds 4 points)
- The letters spawn randomly (random time, random position, random letter) in the upper half of the game field and fall down.
- Once they fall to the bottom they can no longer be removed.
- The game ends when 20 letters get accumulated at the bottom.

Bonus:
- Implemented a ramp up in the speed of the fall for every 100 score the player is able to acquire, making the app more difficult as the time progresses.
